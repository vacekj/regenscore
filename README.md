_Regen_: Short for “regenerative”. A meme-ified term created in response to the mainstream “degen” culture in web3. Refers to the people/culture of using blockchain technology for social/environmental good.

_Score_: well.. you get it.

When you connect your wallet to RegenScore it scans the activity of your address to see, calculate and score your on-chain regen activities; and if you're regen enough, you might even get placed on the leaderboard!
