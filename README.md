# RegenScore

Get your RegenScore [Here](https://regenscore.vercel.app).

_Regen_: Short for “regenerative”. A meme-ified term created in response to the mainstream “degen” culture in web3. Refers to the people/culture of using blockchain technology for social/environmental good.

_Score_: well.. you get it.

When you connect your wallet to RegenScore it scans the activity of your address to see, calculate and score your on-chain regen activities; and if you're regen enough, you might even get placed on the leaderboard!

In the current MVP (season 1) RegenScore will take a peek at the connected users' interactions on a limited set of protocols and their NFT/token holdings that the RegenScore team deemed to be "regen" enough for a PoC. However, in the future RegenScore will be letting community members/supporters suggest and implement other/new queries the dApp can use to fetch data for a more comprehensive RegenScore calculation.

**The current list of protocols/NFT/token holdings we are scoring on include:**

- Gitcoin Grants Round contributors (1-14),
- Giveth donors/$GIV holders,
- Panvala /$PAN holders,
- $KLIMA holders, $sKlima holders,
- $GTC holders,
- interactions with the Greatest LARP (coordination game for funding public goods),
- ETHbot, Moloch, MoonshotBots, Rainbow Rolls, World of Women and Pooly NFT contracts (NFT projects donating raised funds to regen causes),
- donators to the Unchain Fund (Ukraine support),
- Toucan BCT & NCT contract interactions (carbon offsetting),
- Proof of Humanity contract interaction + $UBI holders,
- a couple of regen POAPs (incl. ETHGlobal hackathon POAP holders!),
- and also query if the address has participated in governance through snapshot votes in a list of "ImpactDAO's" (ImpactDAOs are any web3 project that is using crypto to create positive externalities for the world).

After the user has calculated his or her RegenScore they will be able to mint their personal, soulbound NFT with their RegenScore and ENS/address added visually on the actual SVG file to own and show off to frens. The RegenScore NFTs have 4 different backgrounds based on how regen the user's activity is. The usecase for this tokenization of user's RegenScores we hope will be early entrance to regen communities and whitelists to participate in governance of said projects and ecosystems that want to include RegenScore as a tool for sourcing reputable people into their ecosystem. In the next season, in addition to adding more protocols, contracts and on-chain activities to score by; we will implement CTAs for how to improve your regen score.
